# Study-App

To train a model for your study app from scratch, we need to break it down into clear steps:

---

### **1. Define the Workflow**

Your app will:

1. Take a **PDF document** as input.
2. Extract **text** from the PDF.
3. **Summarize** the extracted text.
4. Generate **questions and answers** from the summarized content.

---

### **2. Data Collection**

You'll need datasets for:

- **Summarization** (e.g., news articles with summaries, lecture notes with condensed points).
- **Question Generation** (e.g., datasets where text is paired with questions and answers).

We can use:

- **Public datasets** (Hugging Face Datasets, SQuAD for QA, XSum for summarization).
- **Synthetic datasets** (Generate your own from educational material).

---

### **3. Preprocessing**

- **Extract text** from PDFs (using PyMuPDF, PDFMiner, or PyPDF).
- **Clean the text** (remove unwanted characters, symbols, and formatting issues).
- **Split text into sections** (since PDFs may contain multiple topics).

---

### **4. Model Selection**

Since you want a **free** model (Hugging Face-based), we can fine-tune:

- **Summarization**: T5, BART, Pegasus, or BERTSUM.
- **Question Generation**: T5 or BART.
- **Answer Extraction**: Fine-tune a model like BERT for extractive QA.

---

### **5. Training the Model**

1. **Fine-tune a summarization model** on your dataset.
2. **Fine-tune a question generation model** on educational datasets.
3. **Fine-tune an answer extraction model** for extracting relevant answers.

Weâ€™ll use **Hugging Face Transformers** for training, along with PyTorch or TensorFlow.

---

### **6. Integrating into Your App**

- **Backend (FastAPI)**

  - Handle user-uploaded PDFs.
  - Process and pass the text to models.
  - Return summaries and generated questions.

- **Frontend (Flutter)**
  - Allow users to upload PDFs.
  - Display results (summary, generated Q&A).
  - Possibly add voice output for accessibility.

---

### **7. Deployment**

- Convert models to **ONNX** or **TF Lite** for mobile compatibility.
- Use **Hugging Face Inference API** or **self-host models** on a server.

---

### **Next Steps**

We should first:
âœ… **Preprocess PDFs** (Text extraction, cleaning)  
â¬œ **Choose initial models for summarization & Q&A**  
â¬œ **Fine-tune with domain-specific data**

Would you like to start with text extraction and preprocessing? ðŸš€
